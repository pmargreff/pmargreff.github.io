I have start to mentoring people in the same field I have been active for some years now.

The fun part, the one who make me write about it is, the ilussion that the most senior is also the leader/manager of the group. I even remember when I start to get and first negate that.

It was in my first work experience, not the first one but the first one I consider relevant for my professional develompent, I received several asks about being the team leader. My first question was: why if we have more experienced people (and these people still being my carrer pointers today).

It happened that I had a naive understading about what leader means, the same assumption that the person I'm close mentoring has asked me about. That the most experienced person is also the one with the best fit to lead the group. That can/may be or no true (refrase). Skills that can benefit the group:

- Comunicate clear and often
- Ask dumb or uncofortable questions (remove ambiguity)
- Mantain the team engaged (balancing tech x non-technical tasks)
-

These skills are likelly to be learned while you progress in your carrer. But sometimes some individuals left this abilities behind in order to prioritize time to improve more technical skills (tooling, design, etc). None of them is wrong, both benefits the group in different situations.
