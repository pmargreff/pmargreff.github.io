Tech most of the times is such a priviledged sector for allowing us to shape our make a lot of choices for our carrer. Another intersting fact of tech market is that we need to shape our development in months or a few years instead of decades. The good part of that is that you can be required to expand to unknowns. The bad part is hard to stick with a plan. I could never keep a straight answear of what's next forthe 5 years, today I still without an answear, even having a better idea abot it. One of these factors is that I can be a very inconsistent person as well.

One of things that is clear is that I have the desire of doing it by myself. Having my own bussiness, etc. The main idea is to stretch.

Fortunatelly, my past experiences (at least the relevant ones), helped me to shape my knowledge in different areas, and the fun part is that even if I could not recofnize at the moment, it is crystal clear how to

- On my first experiences I learnt a ton about agile, extremme programming, ownershipa. This opened the door to see that
- Then I learned that you can still build things without loosing your humanity, and keeping work.
- After that I had a class about how to build products that are
- Current: Management matter.

Also, even only listing some key experiences, I had some experiences that besides not giving me a direction, they did a good job on show me what I don't want or what are the flags to be aware of. Another thing that I see as importante in each of these experiences: I was not "a passive learner", I had a lot of exposition.

And it's also important, active exposition is exponentially more efficient on teach you things. It's easy to see why you coworker couldn't implement the process sucessfully, but would you be more efficient on make it happen? Good to learn seeing mistakes (or even acertos) around you, but were you ever bitted by something, I bet you would never cross the street without ensure it's all clear in this aspect again. Then you start to internalize that in a point that you can see the same point that got you comming far away. Then the best you can or advise and wish they to hear you. When someone talks about feeling or experience, very likelly these kind of past experiences are behind it.

When I'm talking about carreer I always highlight how lucky I was, excelence was a constant thing in all these places. Working together which most of individuals of these. But even with that, in the retrospect I wish it was something more planned around my missing abilities in the past: in places where I have the space and situations to practice as well experienced people to do that.

But in the end of the day I wish I was more conscient about drawing that path in the beggining. And that is what I advise for today, will the hottest startup or the big tech help you to archive your long term goals? Yes, so that may be the right choice, no, so keep following that.
