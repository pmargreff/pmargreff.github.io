[Meditations by Marcus Aurelios](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B08RP7Z54J/) is my first real reading from a stoic author. Before that I had readed or listened to a bunch of things about stoicism but never reading stoics authors themselves.

The book was not writen originaly as a book. It was a collection of thoughts from Marcus Aurelius diary that has been later discovered and compiled as a book. They were mostly private thoughts in function of how to the Roman empeor. While Marcus Aurelius was a full time emperor, he had a good educations before that and used most of his knowledge tho rule and Empire (a real one), fight wars

What it makes it so intersting is that Marcus Aurelius was one of the first public person to approach public life drived by philosophy. Oposito to others like Seneca and Aristotle who had a short and so well passanger on politics life, MA (we are brows now), had sucefully applied that when making decisions about public life.


It discourse about what a good life is how that is impacted stoic principles, which takes in consideration mainly the *virtue* . While it does not have a specific topic and it is not grouped as is it has a lot of similar subject in different areas:

- An approach to interpret the world
- About life and death
- How the life relates with the nature and the universe
- Spiritual life

Because the reading does not have an logical order sometimes is easy to get lost on thought because it does not offers an well. That can also be seen as an advantage once it

I read the book in my first language (Portuguese), which made it easier to understand. Even written almost 2000 years ago this still an actual reading, mainly for people who start to discover stoicism and want to start to read it instead of reading resumes about it.
