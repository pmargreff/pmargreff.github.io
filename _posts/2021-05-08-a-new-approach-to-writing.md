It seems like I am starting a new blog one more time. I love to write for countless reasons:

- Elaborate internal thoughts
- It helps me to express myself in a better way
- Reason about beliefs and truths

Thinking about how to do that without slipping into the same old habit of starting but never finishing or publishing writings, I'm trying something new: **Iterate on posts in the agile way** [1]. That means that I'll often publish unfinished thoughts or experiences, and I'll iterate in the process of making it better until it's good enough to move on

This loop offers some advantages over the traditional:

- Publish content faster
- Mature perspective in between writings
- Update outcomes for ongoing situations

At same time this strategy can led to some negative side-effects:

- Unclosed and premature topics can look shallow
- Misinterpretations on unfinished thoughts

Considering I don't have a lot of readers, any losses will count for a lot. On the other hand, Don't have a lot of people reading will limit possible backslash. Also, I'm considering that people are grown, well-intended, and mature while discussing sensitive topics.

Of course that eventually, I'll stop to iterate in something and consider that finished. Rarely worth iterating in something over 10 or 20 years, so let's use Pareto's law and keep improving things that should be improved.

So long and thanks for all the fish!
