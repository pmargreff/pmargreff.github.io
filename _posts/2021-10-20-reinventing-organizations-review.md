[Reinventing Organizations by Frederic Laloux](https://www.amazon.com/Reinventing-Organizations-Frederic-Laloux/dp/2960133501) was my latest reading. I got this book as a gift, and I am very grateful for that. I cannot think of a better gift than helping people in the way out of ignorance.

The book focuses on building a theory to help to categorize organization maturity by its practices. It is divided into three parts:
1. The classification of organizations by their practices
2. Structures, practices and cultures that defines a Teal Organization
3. A "how to" on moving a company to Teal direction

My educational background has not exposed me to social theories. I liked the author's approach. Reading it for the first time is somehow refreshing. When building the classification system, the variables he looks at make sense, even lacking precision caused by the appropriate technology to measure some factors.

The book also goes through differnt use cases of companies from different areas that are adopting Teal practices. Things like eliminating middle management, letting employees to lead projects and defining deadlines. They also use to focus more in the individuals than in the "organization". It also makes sense, considering that individuals have feelings while organizations are abstract things that only exists in our minds.

The book has a theory that makes sense and have some cases to ilustrate it's points, it sometimes goes through a lot of gibberish or pseudo-science. One good example is the bottom line: "A Guide to Creating Organizations Inspired by the Next Stage of Human Consciousness", and that talks by itselfs. The author spent a lot of time on research, interviews, etc. If the author followed the scientific method in a more strict way it could help to build a solid base for future research.

This book does not go in the direction of Marxist theory. Walkable Cities has a quotation for what electric cars are for cars category that I could how the book looks for the work and proposed solutions: "The right answer to the wrong question." As a theory, this book is optimistic and does a decent job of aiming to move the subject from our current state to a better place. I would love to see serious research on this front in the following years, helping to decompose factors that may help companies bring some sanity to workplaces.

Writing a book is not an easy task, and there is no world where I could say that a book is entirely trash. But is hard to ignore pseudo-science that appear sometimes. As general advice, read it if you urge to make things different when helping to build an organization, but stay critical of what the books offer.
