Seems like I am starting a new blog one more time. I love to write, for a countless reasons:

- Elaborate some internal thoughts
- It helps me to express myself in a better way
- Reflect my beliefs and truths

Thinking about how to do that without slip in the same old habit of starting but never finish or publish writings, I arrived to the conclusion about trying something new (rephrase): **Iterate on posts in the agile way** [1]. Which means that I'll often publish unfinish toughts or experiences, and I'll iterate in the process of making it better until it's good enough to move on.

This cycle offers some advantages over the traditional:

- Publish content faster
- Evolve your perspective in between some writings
- Update outcomes for ongoing situations

At same time this strategy can led some negative side-effects:

- Unclosed and premature topics can look shallow
- Misinterpretations on unfinished thoughts

Considering I don't have a lot of readers, any losses will count for a lot. In the other hand, Don't having a lot of people reading will limit possible backslash. Also, I'm considering that people are grown, well inteded, and mature while discussing sensible topics.

Of course that eventually I'll stop to iterate in something and consider that finished. Rarely worth to iterate in something over, 10 or 20 years, so let's use pareto's law and keep improving things that should be improved.

So long and thanks for all the fish!
