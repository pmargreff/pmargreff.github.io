I have put o lot of thoughts about translations latelly. The reason is mainly that I have started to work in an English first environment while being a Portuguese speaker. While doing that I have noticed that I am not the same person on both enviornments. While I can enter in sensible topics, or even deep topics if they are related with my working field. I am not the same person that I am when I am speaking in Portuguese. In rare moments I am the same person in both languages, but that requires me being confortable with the environment in a way that I am not that worried with my mistakes.

Our life is perpetrated by a set of layers with transaltions. I am a very ignorant person, in a sense that world has a lot of things that I ignore, and yet, I can grasps some translations we do without thinking too much.

Now you are limited not only by context, and your knowledge. But also

yada yada some languages do not have the word for blue.

#### Questions on translations

Once you understand that some funny questions rises: How do you know that you see the same red I see? Can you describe red? Can you describe anger?


So my question are the people who eventually meeets me talking with true myself.
