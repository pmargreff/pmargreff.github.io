Hi, I'm Pablo.

Cyclist for fun, I enjoy painting watercolor, urban sketching, human figure, and fine art in general. I'm also a software developer.

While I do love complex problems, functional programming, and distributed systems, my interest in disciplines associated with management has grown recently. Computers are fun, but have you ever tried to understand how people works?

Here you will find my thoughts on most of the topics mentioned above and other miscellaneous as well.

If you need, drop me a message: pmargreff [at] gmail [dot] com
