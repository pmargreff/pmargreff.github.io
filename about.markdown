Hi, I'm Pablo.

Cyclist for fun, mostly on road bikes, I enjoy painting watercolor, urban sketching, human figure, and I appreciate fine art in general. I'm also a software developer, and while I love complex problems, functional programming, and distributed systems, my interest in disciplines associated with management has grown later.

You will find my thought on most of the mentioned subjects above and other miscellaneous as well.

If you need, feel free to drop me a message: pmargreff at gmail dot com.
