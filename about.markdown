Hi, I'm Pablo.

Cyclist for fun, I enjoy painting watercolor, urban sketching, human figure, and fine art in general. I'm also a software developer, and while I love complex problems, functional programming, and distributed systems, my interest in disciplines associated with management has grown recently.

You will find my thought on most of the mentioned topics above and other miscellaneous as well.

Feel free to drop me a message: pmargreff at gmail dot com.
